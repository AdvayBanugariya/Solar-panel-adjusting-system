The Smart Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-powered application designed to help farmers select the most suitable crops for their fields based on real-time environmental and soil data. By analyzing key parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, Humidity, Rainfall, and Temperature, the system predicts optimal crops for cultivation, promoting sustainable farming practices and maximizing agricultural yield.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained Random Forest algorithm with over 99% accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Interactive web interface built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Dynamic Predictions: Accepts soil and environmental data inputs to provide tailored crop recommendations.
Scalable Design: Modular architecture allowing integration of additional features like pest prediction and yield forecasting.

How It Works:
Users input soil nutrient levels and environmental data.
The system preprocesses the data using a trained scaler and predicts the crop using the Random Forest model.
Recommendations are displayed along with insights into the suitability of the chosen crop.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Random Forest (Scikit-learn), MinMaxScaler
Deployment: Designed for scalability and real-world applications.
This project aims to empower farmers with data-driven insights, fostering productivity, sustainability, and informed agricultural decision-making.
