# Solar-panel-adjusting-system
This project aims to design and implement a solar tracking system using Arduino that can optimize the solar energy output by adjusting the solar panel’s position according to the sun’s movement. The system consists of a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor, a servo motor, and an Arduino microcontroller. The LDR sensor detects the light intensity and sends a signal to the Arduino, which controls the servo motor to rotate the solar panel. The system was tested under different lighting conditions and showed an improvement in solar energy output compared to a fixed solar panel.
